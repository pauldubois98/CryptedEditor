	    	<p>This text editor is not very intelligent: you can't put any-thing in bold/italic, you can't controle the colors...<br>
	    	But it has one big advantage: It is highly crypted: it uses the RSA encryption method (see more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">here</a>). It is the method used for your payment card, I hope you find it secure.</p>
	    	<p>The editor is not that hard to use, as it is very simple.<br>
	    	You can open a file in two differents ways (choose using the check button):</p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>As a new file: a new file is created, it may <strong>over-write</strong> an already existing file</li>
	    		<li>... and <em>not</em> as a new file, it will <strong>try</strong> to open an already existing file</li>
	    	</ul>
	    	<p>Then, you have to enter the name of the file, with the <strong>extention</strong>. If you create a new file, you can put any extention you like, it doesn't really make a difference.
	    	The next step is to enter the password, for example, mine is ... nevermind :)
	    	Finally, clic on the button <strong>"open the file"</strong> or hit <strong>"enter"</strong>.</p>
	    	<p>When you open a file, a new frame appears, with the file name as title (you can clic on it to get the RSA keys if you want)<br>
	    	You can write what ever you want on the text entry. You can use the usual shortcuts 'Ctrl-z' (or "Undo" blue button) and 'Ctrl-y' (or "Redo" light blue button). You will need to save manually with the green button "Save". To close the frame, clic on the red "Quit" button. Naturally, the orange "Save & Quit" button save the text and close the frame.</p>
	    	<p>On the top of the editor, there are links to differents pages that explain how the editor works... Have a look!</p>
	    	<br><p>See <a href="aboutUS.html">here</a> context of creation of this text editor</p>
